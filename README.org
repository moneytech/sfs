#+TITLE: sfs

* Overview
This is an attempt to implement the Simple File System.  This is an example
application/package, so it's only limited to version 1.10.

* Tasks
 * DONE Display files and directories with timestamps
 * DONE Read contents of a file
 * TODO Block entries in order of first block (file, unusable, free)
	Other entries:
		- volume: as struct sfs member
		- start: only while reading: do not save
		- unused: do nothing
		- dir: make a set of names (linked list?, hash map?)
		- dir_del: do nothing
	Deleted files:
		- file_del: erase when trying to write and no more space.
		=> when writing: file_del are similar to unusable
 * TODO Delete a file: mark as deleted
	-> deleted files: order
 * TODO Load (write) a file
	1. look in unused
	2. look in unused + 50% oldest deleted files
	3. look in unused + 100% deleted files
 * TODO Linux FUSE implementation
 * TODO Linux VFS implementation
 * TODO FreeDOS implementation
